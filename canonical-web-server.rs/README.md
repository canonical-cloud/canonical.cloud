# canonical-web-server.rs

The Rust application server for **[canonical.cloud](https://canonical.cloud)**.
It is the dynamic half of the product; the sibling
[`canonical-marketing-site.web`](https://github.com/canonical-cloud/canonical-marketing-site.web)
repository remains the static Astro marketing site.

The server uses the sMASH stack:

- **s** — Supabase Auth and Supabase Postgres
- **M** — Maud server-rendered HTML
- **A** — Axum HTTP, REST, and WebSocket routing
- **S** — SeaORM entities, migrations, transactions, and RLS request context
- **H** — HTMX navigation and fragments

The authenticated application includes a TypeScript offline-first client. It
writes draft notes optimistically to IndexedDB, persists an idempotent outbox,
reconciles through the REST API, and treats WebSockets as invalidation hints.
Supabase Postgres remains authoritative; the browser never receives database
credentials or the server's Supabase token pair.

## Architecture

- `crates/canonical-auth/` — transport-neutral Supabase GoTrue client and
  verified identity/token types; it rejects secret/service-role keys.
- `crates/canonical-config/` — isolated configuration loaders for the web,
  migration, and revoker processes, with redacted debug output.
- `crates/canonical-session/` — opaque session crypto, refresh rotation,
  local bearer revocation, and the durable logout state machine.
- `crates/canonical-store/` — SeaORM entities, migrations, connection policy,
  and exact user/admin/revoker transaction boundaries.
- `src/auth/` — Axum extractors, CSRF/Origin checks, and bounded login
  throttling. It adapts the lower-level auth/session crates to HTTP.
- `src/main.rs` / `src/command.rs` — minimal process bootstrap and explicit
  `serve` / `migrate` command dispatch.
- `src/app.rs` / `src/server.rs` — application state, router assembly, network
  listener, PostgreSQL backplane lifecycle, and graceful shutdown.
- `src/database.rs` — SeaORM connection policy and the explicit migration
  entry point; application modules do not construct pools themselves.
- `src/telemetry.rs` — JSON stdout logs for Promtail/Loki plus explicit OTLP
  HTTP spans and low-cardinality metrics for the collector/Prometheus.
- `src/routes/` — probes, Maud/HTMX pages, versioned REST, and authenticated
  WebSocket upgrade handling.
- `src/quote_api.rs` — bounded client and Maud views for the separately deployed
  `canonical-api-server.rs`; it sends the Shared Auth subject under
  `x-canonical-subject`, authenticates with `CANONICAL_INTERNAL_AUTH_TOKEN`,
  and never exposes or selects the owner-scoped database context, Gemini, or
  database credentials.
- `src/sync/` — compare-and-swap mutations, durable idempotency, tombstones,
  owner-bound encrypted cursors, and pull pagination.
- `src/ws/` — owner-scoped in-process fanout plus a bounded PostgreSQL
  `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY` invalidation backplane for multi-instance deployments.
- `services/canonical-session-revoker/` — no-ingress worker binary with no
  dependency on Axum, Maud, customer routes, or WebSockets.
- `client/` — TypeScript, HTMX 2, IndexedDB (`idb`), Web Locks,
  BroadcastChannel, retry/backoff, conflict storage, and WebSocket reconnects.
- `static/` — optional built marketing site supplied through `STATIC_DIR`; it
  is always the final fallback and can never answer `/api`, `/auth`, or `/app`.

Only `draft_note` schema version 1 is accepted by the initial sync protocol.
This deliberately avoids an unrestricted arbitrary-JSON database API. Add a
new kind only with matching validation, authorization, schema, and merge rules.

## Routes

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/healthz` | Dependency-free liveness probe |
| `GET` | `/readyz` | Database readiness probe |
| `GET` | `/login` | Maud login page |
| `POST` | `/auth/login` | Supabase password login and opaque session creation |
| `POST` | `/auth/logout` | CSRF-protected local/Supabase logout |
| `GET` | `/app` | Authenticated Maud application shell |
| `GET`, `POST` | `/u/quote` | Shared-auth-protected compliance quote workflow |
| `GET` | `/u/quote/{quote_id}` | Owner-scoped quote status/detail |
| `GET` | `/app/fragments/session` | HTMX session fragment |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/{health,info,me}` | Versioned REST metadata/current user |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/sync/changes` | Incremental authoritative pull |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/sync/mutations` | Bounded idempotent mutation batch |
| `GET` (Upgrade) | `/ws` | Authenticated typed WebSocket invalidations |

`/api/health` and `/api/info` remain compatibility aliases. Unknown API and
application paths have JSON and HTML 404s respectively rather than falling
through to the marketing SPA.

The `/u/quote` handlers verify the host-only Shared Auth session at the origin,
then call the dedicated API over its private Kubernetes origin. Browser input
cannot choose the internal service token, authenticated subject, Canonical
context record, application Markdown, Gemini key, or Gemini model. The API
selects the authenticated owner's single active context row.

## Multi-instance invalidations

Every committed sync mutation still wakes WebSockets attached to the current
process through a Tokio broadcast channel. On PostgreSQL, the same user-scoped
`{ version, sourceInstance, ownerId, cursor }` hint is also queued with
`pg_notify` inside the authoritative write transaction, so PostgreSQL releases
it only after commit. Each server instance owns a dedicated reconnecting
`LISTEN` connection, ignores its own notifications, validates a strict
512-byte payload bound, and relays remote hints through the same owner-filtered
hub. Listener failure does not stop HTTP service and reconnects with capped
backoff. Budget one additional PostgreSQL connection per server instance beyond
the SeaORM pool configured by `DATABASE_MAX_CONNECTIONS`.

These messages are deliberately disposable wake-ups: duplicates and missed
notifications are safe, message payloads never contain record data or auth
material, and clients must always use REST pull plus its encrypted durable
cursor to learn authoritative state.

## Supabase setup

Use a Supabase **publishable** key for user authentication. Do not configure a
secret/service-role key for this application path. The server calls GoTrue
directly, stores access/refresh tokens encrypted in `web_session`, and gives the
browser only a random `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax`, `__Host-` cookie.
REST clients may send a Supabase bearer token; the first implementation verifies
it with the authenticating `/auth/v1/user` request rather than trusting decoded
claims.

`/auth/login` accepts only a 16 KiB form and has a bounded, normalized-account
throttle before it contacts Supabase. `LOGIN_AUTH_MAX_CONCURRENCY` (default 16)
also caps the complete password exchange plus local session insert; excess work
gets a fail-closed `429` with `Retry-After` instead of waiting in an unbounded
queue. Configure a stronger trusted-client-IP limit at the edge; this process
intentionally does not trust forwarded-IP headers. Production origins fail
startup unless cookies are secure and `__Host-` prefixed, and session lifetime
is limited to 1–30 days.

Logout revokes the opaque local session first, then confirms Supabase sign-out.
An upstream outage creates a durable, encrypted-token-backed retry record. The
separately deployed `canonical-session-revoker` retries it with a short
database lease and backoff, revokes expired local sessions, and prunes terminal
records only after their access JWT has expired plus the retention window.
Rejected credentials enter an explicit dead-letter state rather than being
misreported as a successful logout. A revoked Supabase `session_id` is also
denied locally while its JWT could still be valid.

| Process | Ingress | Database identity | Supabase key | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `canonical-web-server` | HTTP/HTMX/REST/WebSocket | `canonical_web_server` | publishable only | Customer requests and durable logout enqueue |
| `canonical-session-revoker` | none | `canonical_session_revoker` | publishable only | Bounded logout reconciliation only |
| `canonical-web-server migrate` | deploy job only | migration owner | none | Schema migration only |
| future admin service | separate origin | `canonical_admin_server` | isolated admin credential only if required | MFA/AAL2 capability functions and audit |

Before adding an admin surface, create a separate origin/service with MFA or
reauthentication, an immutable audit trail, and a narrowly scoped deployment
credential. Do not add an owner-RLS bypass or a Supabase service-role key to the
customer-facing server.

The database boundary for that future service is already fail-closed. Bounded
`admin_role_assignment` rows map four roles to explicit capabilities, while
`admin_audit_event` is append-only from the runtime's perspective. Both tables
use forced RLS with no customer policy, and `canonical_web_server` receives no
table or function grants for them. Run `bootstrap_admin_role.sql` only for a
separate deployment: it creates a non-owner, non-`BYPASSRLS`
`canonical_admin_server` login with no direct table access and grants only
capability lookup plus audit append. Adding a real admin operation requires a
new capability-checking function and an explicit bootstrap grant; customer
owner policies remain unchanged.

See [`docs/process-boundaries.md`](docs/process-boundaries.md) for the
compile-time, credential, database-role, and deployment contracts shared by
these workspace packages without collapsing their authorities.

The future admin server must verify a fresh Supabase access token before every
privileged transaction, require its `aal` claim to equal `aal2`, and install the
verified `sub` plus the complete claims JSON with transaction-local
`set_config` calls. The database functions derive the actor from `auth.uid()`;
there is no caller-supplied actor argument, so audit events cannot impersonate
another operator through the function API. Never accept these settings from an
HTTP parameter or an unverified JWT.

The runtime `DATABASE_URL` must use a dedicated least-privilege Postgres role,
not `postgres`, the table owner, or a role with `BYPASSRLS`. User-owned SeaORM
operations install the validated user ID in transaction-local
`request.jwt.claim.sub` and `request.jwt.claims` settings; the migration enables
and forces owner RLS. Supavisor session mode or a direct connection is required
for the long-lived SeaORM pool and the dedicated PostgreSQL `LISTEN` connection;
transaction mode cannot preserve listener session state.

Every long-lived PostgreSQL process verifies both `session_user` and
`current_user`, the expected login's unsafe attributes, role memberships, and
ownership of the database or application objects before starting work. A
mistakenly mounted owner credential, `SET ROLE` impersonation, or drifted web,
admin, or revoker login therefore fails closed. (SQLite skips this catalog
check only for isolated local tests.)

Use the migration-only command during deployment. It loads
`MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL` instead of the runtime `DATABASE_URL` and does not
construct the HTTP or Supabase Auth clients:

```sh
MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL='postgresql://PRIVILEGED_CONNECTION' \
  canonical-web-server migrate
psql "$MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL" \
  --file deploy/postgres/bootstrap_runtime_role.sql
psql "$MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL" \
  --file deploy/postgres/bootstrap_session_revoker_role.sql
canonical-web-server serve
canonical-session-revoker check
canonical-session-revoker run
```

If and only if the separate admin service is deployed, bootstrap its independent
database identity in the migration job and configure its password outside Git:

```sh
psql "$MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL" \
  --file deploy/postgres/bootstrap_admin_role.sql
```

Supabase schema changes are managed declaratively with
[dpm](https://github.com/declarative-migrations/declarative-postgres-migrate.rs):
`deploy/postgres/schema.sql` is the desired-state source of truth, and CI
proves the SeaORM migrations converge with it on every change (the
`declarative-schema` job). Against a live Supabase database, generate and
review a migration instead of hand-writing DDL — connect via the direct
connection or session pooler (5432), never the transaction pooler:

```sh
dpm diff   --source deploy/postgres/schema.sql --target "$MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL"            --shadow "$SHADOW_DATABASE_URL"      # review the SQL
dpm verify --source deploy/postgres/schema.sql --target "$MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL"            --shadow "$SHADOW_DATABASE_URL"      # rehearse on a shadow replica
dpm apply  --source deploy/postgres/schema.sql --target "$MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL"            --shadow "$SHADOW_DATABASE_URL"      # interactive confirm before writes
```

Destructive changes require dpm's two explicit consent flags and stay
commented out otherwise; grants are out of dpm's scope and stay in
`bootstrap_runtime_role.sql`.

The migrations are also proven against **CockroachDB** (v25.2+, which speaks
the Postgres wire protocol and supports forced RLS): the `cockroach-rls` CI
job applies the full chain to a single-node cluster and asserts the same
owner-isolation contract. Three documented divergences: CockroachDB validates
foreign keys with the inserting role's privileges (grant the app role SELECT
on `auth.users`), and it has no LISTEN/NOTIFY, so the WebSocket invalidation
backplane is Postgres-only — REST pull remains authoritative either way. It
also does not implement the PostgreSQL SECURITY DEFINER function forms used by
the admin capability/audit boundary; those functions are intentionally absent
there, while forced RLS with no admin-table policies keeps access fail-closed.

The bootstrap creates `canonical_web_server` as a non-owner,
non-`BYPASSRLS` login without a password and grants only the application's
current tables. It grants no blanket sequence access and fails if an effective
`PUBLIC` or parent-role table, sequence, or function privilege would widen any
process's reviewed object surface. Set its password or another authentication mechanism through
the deployment secret manager, never in this repository, then use that role in
`DATABASE_URL`. Startup rechecks the exact login, unsafe attributes,
memberships, and application-object ownership. Re-run the bootstrap after
future migrations change an allow-list. The long-lived `serve` process has no
automatic migration path and therefore never needs owner credentials.

Copy `.env.example` to an ignored local environment file and replace every
placeholder. `APP_SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEY` must be standard-base64 for exactly
32 random bytes and must be stored outside the database.

## Develop

```sh
direnv allow                       # or: nix develop ./.nix / ./shell
npm ci --prefix client
npm run build --prefix client
cargo run -- migrate               # local/fresh database only
cargo run -- serve
```

PostgreSQL startup requires the exact non-DDL `canonical_web_server` role, so
apply migrations first with `canonical-web-server migrate` and
`MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL`, run the runtime/revoker bootstrap scripts, then
serve with the runtime URL.

For the full local stack, build the sibling marketing site and set:

```sh
STATIC_DIR=../canonical-marketing-site.web/dist
```

SQLite is compiled in for focused local/integration tests. Production should
use Supabase Postgres with TLS.

## Observability

The server always writes compact JSON logs to stdout, which Kubernetes exposes
as CRI logs for Promtail and Loki. Set `RUST_LOG` to tune filtering; credentials,
cookies, bearer tokens, request bodies, and database URLs are never span fields.

Set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` to an OTLP/gRPC collector endpoint (port 4317
in the target cluster) to enable batched traces and metrics. Every HTTP request
gets a W3C-parent-aware server span with route, method, request ID, response
status, trace ID, and span ID. The service exports request count and duration
with only bounded status attributes; the cluster collector publishes those
metrics on its Prometheus exporter. If OTLP is not configured or exporter setup
fails, the service continues with stdout logging.

## Verify

```sh
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --all-targets --locked
npm test --prefix client
npm run typecheck --prefix client
npm run build --prefix client
```

The Rust tests use in-memory SQLite and a fake Auth provider; they do not need
Supabase secrets. They cover route precedence, opaque login sessions, bearer
identity, sync idempotency/conflicts/pull, authentication-before-upgrade, and a
real WebSocket connection receiving a typed owner-scoped invalidation. Unit
tests also cover strict backplane decoding, size bounds, and source-instance
deduplication without requiring PostgreSQL. CI also runs a
PostgreSQL 17 fixture that migrates as an owner, connects as the dedicated
runtime login, proves no-claim and cross-user isolation, and verifies rolled-back
notifications are suppressed while committed hints are delivered. Run that
fixture locally only against a disposable loopback PostgreSQL cluster whose
`postgres` database is named in `TEST_POSTGRES_ADMIN_URL`:

```sh
TEST_POSTGRES_ADMIN_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres \
  cargo test --test postgres_rls -- --nocapture
```

## Container

The multi-stage Dockerfile exposes separate least-privilege `web` and
`revoker` targets. The web image contains only the HTTP binary and client
assets; the revoker image contains only the no-ingress worker. Both run as the
distroless non-root user, and every base image is pinned by digest.

```sh
docker build --target web -t canonical-web-server .
docker build --target revoker -t canonical-session-revoker .
docker run --env-file .env.local -p 8081:8081 \
  -v "$PWD/static:/app/static:ro" canonical-web-server
docker run --env-file .env.revoker.local canonical-session-revoker check
docker run --env-file .env.revoker.local canonical-session-revoker run
```

## Cross-surface delivery

User-visible, quote, intake, framework, context, evidence, authentication,
notification, permission, navigation, or deep-link changes in this Rust web/BFF
must be evaluated for:

- `canonical-cloud/canonical-agent-flutter` on Android, iOS, Flutter Web/mobile
  web, and Flutter desktop when that proposed client is activated;
- `canonical-cloud/canonical-agent-desktop.rs`, the proposed Rust desktop/local
  evidence agent; and
- Canonical interfaces, generated clients, quote/intake/framework/context/
  evidence schemas, route types, compliance fixtures, and conformance tests.

This is judgment-based coordination. Public marketing, SEO, server-rendered
quote presentation, and browser-only account administration may remain
web-specific. Local filesystem inventories, evidence collection, policy checks,
browser/device attestations, watched folders, secure upload queues,
signing/update behavior, and offline collection may be native-specific. Quote
and intake semantics, framework selection, context records, evidence status,
authentication, permissions, errors, notifications, and navigation normally
require coordinated changes or an explicit no-change rationale and parity
follow-up.

Mobile does not need privileged local-evidence collection merely for parity. A
good design may keep collection in the signed desktop agent while mobile
provides status, approval, notification, and deep-link workflows. The native
repositories remain proposed allocation targets and must not be described as
published until their remotes and builds are verified.

Deep links are HTTPS-first:

```text
https://<verified-canonical-owned-host>/open/<route>?<bounded-query>
```

The exact host must be proven before publication. A custom-scheme fallback
requires a reviewed ADR and must not be guessed. Web and future clients must
share versioned route types and fixtures and support cold start,
already-running delivery, authentication resume, replay/expiry rejection,
browser fallback, and explicit confirmation before quote submission, evidence
import/upload, connector changes, attestations, approvals, or destructive
operations.

Quote answers, compliance evidence, private documents, filesystem inventories,
absolute local paths, browser/device attestations, credentials, Supabase
sessions, service tokens, model prompts/context, personally identifiable
information, bearer/refresh tokens, and signing material are prohibited in
URLs. Use bounded identifiers or short-lived, single-use, audience-bound codes
and validate route version, user/quote/framework/context/evidence identity,
action, authorization, assurance level, limits, and user intent.

[portfolio policy](https://github.com/ORESoftware/project-registry/blob/main/docs/cross-surface-delivery.md).
