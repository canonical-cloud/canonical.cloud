# Agent guidelines — canonical-web-server.rs

Rust sMASH application server for **canonical.cloud**: Supabase Auth/Postgres,
Maud, Axum, SeaORM, HTMX, REST, WebSockets, and an IndexedDB sync client. The
static marketing site lives in `canonical-marketing-site.web` and is only the
server's final filesystem fallback.

## Layout

- `crates/canonical-auth/` — transport-neutral Supabase Auth client and
  verified credential/identity types. It must reject secret/service-role keys.
- `crates/canonical-config/` — process-specific web, migration, and revoker
  configuration with redacted debug output.
- `crates/canonical-session/` — opaque session crypto, refresh rotation,
  durable logout reconciliation, and local bearer revocation.
- `crates/canonical-store/` — SeaORM entities/migrations and exact
  user/admin/revoker transaction boundaries.
- `services/canonical-session-revoker/` — no-ingress worker. It must not
  depend on `canonical-web-server`, Axum, Maud, routes, or WebSockets.
- `src/main.rs` / `src/command.rs` — telemetry/bootstrap and explicit
  `serve` / `migrate` command dispatch only.
- `src/auth/` — Axum authentication extractors, CSRF/Origin checks, and
  bounded login throttling.
- `src/app.rs`, `src/server.rs` — state/router assembly and network lifecycle.
- `src/database.rs` — SeaORM pool policy and the explicit migration command.
- `src/telemetry.rs` — stdout JSON logs plus OTLP HTTP traces/metrics.
- `src/routes/`, `src/views/`, `src/ws/` — HTTP, Maud/HTMX, and WebSockets.
- `src/sync/` — versioned/idempotent REST sync protocol.
- `client/` — TypeScript/IndexedDB optimistic client and HTMX bundle.
- `tests/app.rs` — router, auth, sync, and real WebSocket integration tests.
- `static/` — uncommitted marketing build selected by `STATIC_DIR`.

## Working here

```sh
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --all-targets --locked
npm test --prefix client
npm run typecheck --prefix client
npm run build --prefix client
```

Run locally with an ignored environment file based on `.env.example`. For
production, migrate with a privileged database identity and run with a separate
least-privilege, non-`BYPASSRLS` role.

## Security invariants

- `/healthz` remains dependency-free; `/readyz` may probe the database.
- Static marketing fallback is always last. `/api`, `/auth`, and `/app` must
  retain their own 404 behavior. `/admin` and `/api/admin` are reserved for a
  separately deployed admin origin and must never fall through to marketing.
- Never log passwords, cookies, Authorization headers, Supabase tokens, DB
  URLs, encryption keys, or upstream Auth response bodies.
- Browser sessions are opaque. Supabase access/refresh tokens remain encrypted
  at rest and are never exposed through the browser session cookie.
- A locally revoked Supabase `session_id` remains denied while its access JWT
  can still be valid. Upstream credential rejection is a dead-letter state,
  never a successful revocation.
- Cookie-authenticated unsafe HTTP requests require both exact Origin and CSRF.
  Browser WebSockets require exact Origin before upgrade. Never place tokens in
  WebSocket URLs or subprotocols.
- Every user-owned repository method derives ownership from verified auth and
  runs in a user-context transaction. Never accept `owner_id` from a payload.
- PostgreSQL web startup must verify the exact `canonical_web_server` login
  before migration or HTTP binding; never weaken this to a privilege heuristic.
- Production revoker code routes `web_session` DML through
  `begin_session_revocation_transaction` and never installs a customer claim.
  Its exact database login is non-owner, non-`BYPASSRLS`, non-inheritable, and
  has no application ingress.
  The transaction marker is an audit/accidental-use guard, not authorization;
  custom PostgreSQL settings are caller-settable, so the isolated exact role
  and its one-table grant are the security boundary.
- Admin capability functions require a freshly verified AAL2 identity and
  derive the actor from `auth.uid()`. Do not add an admin route, owner-RLS
  bypass, or admin credential to the customer web process.
- IndexedDB is optimistic, not authoritative. WebSocket messages only wake a
  REST pull; they never advance the durable cursor.
- Versions are decimal strings over the wire; server writes use exact CAS.
  Tombstoned IDs are not resurrected, and mutation IDs are immutable.
- New sync kinds require bounded validation and explicit authorization; do not
  turn the protocol into unrestricted arbitrary JSON storage.
- No secrets in the repository. The customer web and revoker processes accept
  only a Supabase publishable/legacy-anon key. A secret/service-role key, if a
  future admin capability genuinely needs one, belongs only in that separate
  service's deployment environment.

## Command safety

Agents working in this repo must **not** run destructive shell commands.

**Blacklisted (never run):** `rm`, `rm -rf`, `rmdir`, `dd`, `mkfs`, `shred`,
`truncate`, `> file` truncation, `find … -delete`, `git clean -fdx`,
`git reset --hard` on shared branches, `git push --force` to `main`, and any
`sudo`-prefixed or disk/format command.

**Whitelisted (prefer these):** `git rm` and `git mv` for tracked removals and
moves, `git restore` / `git revert` to undo, and files under ignored
`tmp/worktrees/` for scratch work. Let a human review staged removals.

## Git worktrees

Only when a human explicitly instructs use of a worktree, place it under `tmp/worktrees/<branch>` `tmp/` is ignored.

## Syncing with the remote

"Sync with the remote" (or just "sync") is a **two-way** exchange — pull the
remote's commits down **and** push yours up. It is never push-only, and a clean
local tree does not by itself mean "synced": you are done only once local and
the remote hold the same commits.

To sync:

1. **Commit your work first** (`git add` + `git commit`) so the tree is clean —
   pull/merge only into a clean tree. `git pull` / `git merge` aborts when an
   incoming change touches a file you have edited, and even when it doesn't it
   buries the merge in your uncommitted work. (Can't commit yet? `git stash`,
   then `git stash pop` after step 3.)
2. `git fetch --all --prune` — safe any time; it only updates tracking refs.
3. `git pull` (fetch + merge) — or `git merge` the upstream branch — to
   integrate the remote's commits.
4. `git push` to publish yours.

Integrate with **`git merge` / `git pull`**. **Never `git rebase` to sync** — it
rewrites history and breaks shared branches.

## Primary branch and concurrent-agent policy

This policy overrides generic feature-branch and worktree defaults for agent tooling.

- Highly prefer an existing primary branch, in this order: `main`, `dev`, then `master`.
- Work directly on the selected primary branch even when other agents are active. Use another branch only when a human or a repository-specific release process explicitly requires it.
- Never create or use a Git worktree unless a human explicitly instructs you to do so for the current task. Concurrency alone is not permission to use a worktree.
- Concurrent agents must coordinate repository and file ownership through the available agent communication channel, keep edits scoped, inspect live state before each write, and hand off cleanly. Coordinate instead of isolating routine work in worktrees.
- Preserve unrelated in-progress changes and never overwrite another agent's work. If safe ownership of overlapping files cannot be established, pause that overlapping edit and coordinate before continuing.
