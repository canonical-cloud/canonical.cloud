# Agent guidelines — canonical-marketing-site.web

[Astro](https://astro.build) marketing site for **canonical.cloud** (SOC 2,
FedRAMP & HIPAA compliance audits). Static build; served in production by
`canonical-web-server.rs` out of its `static/` dir.

## Layout

- `src/pages/index.astro` — the single landing page (hero, stats, services,
  process, frameworks, why, testimonial, CTA).
- `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` — `<head>` metadata, nav, footer.
- `src/styles/global.css` — design tokens + base styles.
- `tests/` — `node --test` specs (static contract + Playwright + Puppeteer e2e).

## Working here

- Enter the dev shell: `direnv allow` (or `nix develop ./.nix`, or `./shell`).
- `npm run dev` — local dev server (http://localhost:4321).
- `npm run build` — production build to `dist/`.
- `npm run preview` — serve the built `dist/`.

## Tests

- `npm test` — fast static-contract specs (no browser); the CI gate.
- `npm run test:browser` — builds, then runs the Playwright **and** Puppeteer
  e2e specs (both runners) via `node --test`. Needs a local Chrome; set
  `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` / `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM` or let Puppeteer download
  one. Best-effort in CI.
- Point the browser suite at an already-running site with
  `CANONICAL_SITE_TEST_URL=http://localhost:4321`.

## Command safety

Agents working in this repo must **not** run destructive shell commands.

**Blacklisted (never run):** `rm`, `rm -rf`, `rmdir`, `dd`, `mkfs`, `shred`,
`truncate`, `> file` truncation, `find … -delete`, `git clean -fdx`,
`git reset --hard` on shared branches, `git push --force` to `main`, and any
`sudo`-prefixed or disk/format command.

**Whitelisted (prefer these):** `git rm` and `git mv` to delete/move tracked
files (they stay reviewable and reversible via history), `git restore` /
`git revert` to undo, and creating files under the gitignored `tmp/` for scratch
work. When something genuinely must be removed, stage it with `git rm` and let a
human review the commit — do not delete files out-of-band with `rm`.

## Git worktrees

`tmp/worktrees/` (e.g. `tmp/worktrees/<branch>`) is reserved for a worktree only when a human explicitly instructs its use.
`tmp/` is gitignored, so worktree checkouts never show up as untracked files or
get committed by accident.

## Conventions

- Keep links base-aware: use `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` (see `BaseLayout.astro`)
  so the site works both at `/` locally and behind a gateway prefix.
- Any content change to nav labels, service cards, or framework names must keep
  the `tests/site-contract.test.mjs` assertions in sync (or update them).
- No secrets in the repo.

## Syncing with the remote

"Sync with the remote" (or just "sync") is a **two-way** exchange — pull the
remote's commits down **and** push yours up. It is never push-only, and a clean
local tree does not by itself mean "synced": you are done only once local and
the remote hold the same commits.

To sync:

1. **Commit your work first** (`git add` + `git commit`) so the tree is clean —
   pull/merge only into a clean tree. `git pull` / `git merge` aborts when an
   incoming change touches a file you have edited, and even when it doesn't it
   buries the merge in your uncommitted work. (Can't commit yet? `git stash`,
   then `git stash pop` after step 3.)
2. `git fetch --all --prune` — safe any time; it only updates tracking refs.
3. `git pull` (fetch + merge) — or `git merge` the upstream branch — to
   integrate the remote's commits.
4. `git push` to publish yours.

Integrate with **`git merge` / `git pull`**. **Never `git rebase` to sync** — it
rewrites history and breaks shared branches.

## Primary branch and concurrent-agent policy

This policy overrides generic feature-branch and worktree defaults for agent tooling.

- Highly prefer an existing primary branch, in this order: `main`, `dev`, then `master`.
- Work directly on the selected primary branch even when other agents are active. Use another branch only when a human or a repository-specific release process explicitly requires it.
- Never create or use a Git worktree unless a human explicitly instructs you to do so for the current task. Concurrency alone is not permission to use a worktree.
- Concurrent agents must coordinate repository and file ownership through the available agent communication channel, keep edits scoped, inspect live state before each write, and hand off cleanly. Coordinate instead of isolating routine work in worktrees.
- Preserve unrelated in-progress changes and never overwrite another agent's work. If safe ownership of overlapping files cannot be established, pause that overlapping edit and coordinate before continuing.
