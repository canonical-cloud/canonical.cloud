# Agent guidelines — canonical-monorepo

Git superproject for the canonical-cloud repos. Each app lives in its own repo
and is tracked here as a submodule under `apps/`:

- `apps/canonical-web-server.rs` — modular Rust workspace containing the sMASH
  application server, a no-ingress session-revoker service, shared crates, and
  the TypeScript/IndexedDB sync client
- `apps/canonical-marketing-site.web` — Astro static marketing site

## Working here

- Clone/refresh with submodules: `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
- Change app code **inside the submodule** (`apps/<app>`), commit and push there
  first, then update the pin here with `scripts/pin-submodules.sh main`.
- The superproject only ever stores submodule *pins* (gitlinks) + shared config
  (CI, docs, scripts). Don't vendor app source directly into the superproject.
- `./build.sh` builds the marketing site, verifies/builds the HTMX/IndexedDB
  application client, and builds every Rust workspace binary for a full stack.
- `npm test` runs the `node --test` contract specs that keep the submodule
  wiring, README, and scripts honest.

## Command safety

Agents working in this repo must **not** run destructive shell commands.

**Blacklisted (never run):** `rm`, `rm -rf`, `rmdir`, `dd`, `mkfs`, `shred`,
`truncate`, `> file` truncation, `find … -delete`, `git clean -fdx`,
`git reset --hard` on shared branches, `git submodule deinit`,
`git push --force` to `main`, and any `sudo`-prefixed or disk/format command.
Deleting a submodule checkout with `rm -rf apps/<app>` is especially forbidden —
it silently corrupts the superproject's gitlink state.

**Whitelisted (prefer these):** `git rm` and `git mv` to delete/move tracked
files (they stay reviewable and reversible via history), `git restore` /
`git revert` to undo, `git submodule update` to reconcile checkouts, and the
`scripts/*.sh` helpers (which are intentionally push-free and offer `--dry-run`
/ `--allow-dirty` guards). When something must be removed, stage it with
`git rm` and let a human review the commit — never delete files with `rm`.

## Git worktrees

`tmp/worktrees/` (e.g. `tmp/worktrees/<branch>`) is reserved for a worktree only when a human explicitly instructs its use.
`tmp/` is gitignored, so worktree checkouts never show up as untracked files or
get committed by accident.

## Scripts

- `scripts/pin-submodules.sh <branch>` — pin every submodule to a branch tip.
- `scripts/checkout-feature-branch.sh <branch>` — switch superproject + every
  submodule to the same feature branch.
- `scripts/audit-repo-state.sh` — check for conflict markers, tracked secrets,
  and submodule/readme drift.

All three refuse to `git push` and validate branch names; the mutating ones
support `--dry-run`.

## Syncing with the remote

"Sync with the remote" (or just "sync") is a **two-way** exchange — pull the
remote's commits down **and** push yours up. It is never push-only, and a clean
local tree does not by itself mean "synced": you are done only once local and
the remote hold the same commits.

To sync:

1. **Commit your work first** (`git add` + `git commit`) so the tree is clean —
   pull/merge only into a clean tree. `git pull` / `git merge` aborts when an
   incoming change touches a file you have edited, and even when it doesn't it
   buries the merge in your uncommitted work. (Can't commit yet? `git stash`,
   then `git stash pop` after step 3.)
2. `git fetch --all --prune` — safe any time; it only updates tracking refs.
3. `git pull` (fetch + merge) — or `git merge` the upstream branch — to
   integrate the remote's commits.
4. `git push` to publish yours.

Integrate with **`git merge` / `git pull`**. **Never `git rebase` to sync** — it
rewrites history and breaks shared branches.

## Primary branch and concurrent-agent policy

This policy overrides generic feature-branch and worktree defaults for agent tooling.

- Highly prefer an existing primary branch, in this order: `main`, `dev`, then `master`.
- Work directly on the selected primary branch even when other agents are active. Use another branch only when a human or a repository-specific release process explicitly requires it.
- Never create or use a Git worktree unless a human explicitly instructs you to do so for the current task. Concurrency alone is not permission to use a worktree.
- Concurrent agents must coordinate repository and file ownership through the available agent communication channel, keep edits scoped, inspect live state before each write, and hand off cleanly. Coordinate instead of isolating routine work in worktrees.
- Preserve unrelated in-progress changes and never overwrite another agent's work. If safe ownership of overlapping files cannot be established, pause that overlapping edit and coordinate before continuing.
